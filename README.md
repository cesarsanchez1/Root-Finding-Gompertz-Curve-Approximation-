# Root-Finding-Gompertz-Curve-Approximation-
 The Gompertz model is well known and widely used in many aspects of biology. It has been frequently used to describe the growth of animals and plants, as well as the number or volume of bacteria and cancer cells. In this project we will use the formula to approximate root values.
